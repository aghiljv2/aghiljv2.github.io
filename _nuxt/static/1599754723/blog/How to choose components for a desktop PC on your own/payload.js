But if not considering raytracing support for now, one could say the AMD GPUs are on par with NVIDIA. While \tbuying the GPU, you have to make sure that the GPU you select I compatible with the motherboard and will not offer \tmuch of a bottleneck to your processor or the memory. The connection ports should also be kept in mind because, if \tthe port version on the motherboard is older than that of the GPU, it will result in slower speeds than expected. \u003C\u002Fp\u003E \u003Cbr \u002F\u003E \u003Cbr \u002F\u003E\u003Cb\u003EPower Supply (PSU)\u003C\u002Fb\u003E\u003Cbr \u002F\u003E \u003Cbr \u002F\u003E \u003Cimg style=\"width: 100%;\" src=\"\u002Fimg\u002Fblog\u002F290620\u002Fpsu.jpg\" alt=\"PSU\" \u002F\u003E \u003Cbr \u002F\u003E\u003Cbr \u002F\u003E \u003Cp\u003E \tUndoubtedly, this is one of the most overlooked part while building a PC. You have to keep in mind the power \trequirement of every other component in your build and then while choosing the PSU, it should cover all those needs. \tAlways go for PSUs with an 80+ certification. There are 80+ white, bronze, silver, gold, platinum and titanium \tcertifications. It just refers to the efficiency of the PSU in delivering the power. 80+ means, it will do it with \tat least 80% efficiency.

The CPU should have a dedicated cooler – no questions asked. \tYou can have air\u002Fwater cooling according to your need and convenience. Most of the new AMD processors, comes with a \tstock cooler, but you could opt for another cooler as per your need. In case of Intel, you have to buy a separate \tcooler.
